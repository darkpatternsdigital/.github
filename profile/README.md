# We are Dark Patterns Digital

Dark Patterns Digital, LCA is a technology worker cooperative built with the
goal of creating software that measures up to the best practices of the software
industry. As members of Dark Patterns Digital, we believe that the best way to
accomplish that goal is to leverage well-gelled teams; our teams are designed to
be long-lasting and energizing for their members.

## We are a Worker Cooperative

Dark Patterns Digital is registered as a Limited Cooperative Association (LCA)
under the laws of the State of Colorado. As a cooperative, we adhere to the
seven cooperative principles:

1. Open and Voluntary Membership
2. Democratic Member Control
3. Membersâ€™ Economic Participation
4. Autonomy and Independence
5. Education, Training, and Information
6. Cooperation Among Cooperatives
7. Concern for Community

We believe that the best way to ask someone to take ownership of a problem is
ultimately to offer them actual ownership; as a cooperative, we literally do
that for our entire team. With this approach, every member of Dark Patterns
Digital is fully invested in the success of every project we take on.

## We are Experts

Dark Patterns Digital is founded by industry veterans with decades of
experience; we have been though multiple startups, worked on many software
projects, and led various-sized teams. We have the expertise to go from board
room to the server room, identifying the hidden positive and negative patterns.

We earned our expertise by being workers, and we continue to pursue the
improvement of our craft. When automating releases, building libraries,
designing a user interface, or simply writing documentation, we seek to
understand the subtle patterns that create the most successful projects.

## We are Pattern Recognizers

We see trends that the technology industry is taking: Software is getting more
complex, and the requirements to be productive as an engineer are increasing,
too. We believe that it is essential that we find the common patterns and bulid
tooling around them in order to elevate the newer members of our profession to
be productive.

When building that tooling, we seek to make it flexible to work for many others
within the industry. We believe that by providing tools and services for others
that are approachable and open-source, we can make the best software easy to
write and maintain for both industry veterans and newcomers alike.
